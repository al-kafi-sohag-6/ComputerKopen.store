                                        <p>We offer visitors to our Website the opportunity to contact us through the WhatsApp news service of WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. For this purpose, we use the so-called "Business Version" of WhatsApp.</p>
                                        <p>If you contact us via WhatsApp in connection with a specific business transaction (e.g., an order placed), we will store and use the mobile phone number you use at WhatsApp and - if provided - your first name and surname in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. DSGVO for processing and answering your request. Based on the same legal basis, we will ask you via WhatsApp to provide further data (order number, customer number, address, or e-mail address), if necessary, in order to be able to assign your request to a specific transaction.</p>
                                        <p>If you use our WhatsApp contact for general inquiries (e.g., about our range of services, availability, or our Internet presence), we will store and use the mobile phone number you use at WhatsApp and - if provided - your first and last name in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interest in the efficient and prompt provision of the requested information.</p>
                                        <p>Your data will always be used only to answer your request via WhatsApp. Your data will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
                                        <p>Please note that WhatsApp Business gains access to the address book of the mobile device we use for this purpose and automatically transfers telephone numbers stored in the address book to a server of the parent company Facebook Inc. in the USA. To operate our WhatsApp Business account, we use a mobile device whose address book stores only the WhatsApp contact data of users who have contacted us via WhatsApp.</p>
                                        <p>This ensures that every person whose WhatsApp contact data is stored in our address book has already consented to the transmission of his WhatsApp telephone number from the address books of his chat contacts in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO when using the app on his device for the first time by accepting the WhatsApp terms of use. The transmission of data of such users who do not use WhatsApp and/or have not contacted us via WhatsApp is therefore excluded.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by WhatsApp as well as your rights and settings options to protect your privacy are described in WhatsApp's privacy policy: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/?eea=1#privacy-policy</p>

                                        <p>- Right of rectification under Art. 16 DPA: You have the right to have incorrect data relating to you corrected without delay and/or to have your incomplete data stored by us completed;</p>
                                        <p>- Right of deletion in accordance with Art. 17 DSGVO: You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data if the conditions of Art. 17 para. 1 DSGVO is met.

                                        <p>- Right to limit processing pursuant to Art. 18 DPA: You have the right to request the limitation of the processing of your personal data for as long as the accuracy of your data which you dispute is verified if you refuse to delete your data on the grounds of unlawful processing and instead request the limitation of the processing of your data, if you require your data for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims after we no longer require such data after the purpose has been achieved, or if you have lodged an objection on grounds of your particular situation, as long as it has not yet been established that our legitimate reasons outweigh the objection;</p>
                                        <p>- Right to information in accordance with Art. 19 DSGVO: If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing vis-à-vis the controller, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you have been disclosed of this rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed about these recipients.</p>
                                        <p>- Right to data transferability in accordance with Art. 20 DSGVO: You have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided us with in a structured, common, and machine-readable format or to request that it be transferred to another person responsible, insofar as this is technically feasible;</p>
                                        <p>- Right to revoke the given consents pursuant to Art. 7 para. 3 DSGVO: You have the right to revoke at any time with effect for the future and consent to the processing of data once permitted. In the event of revocation, we will immediately delete the data concerned unless further processing cannot be based on a legal basis for processing without consent.
